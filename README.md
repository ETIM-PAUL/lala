# Getting Started with Create React App

I Use the IMDB API provided by RapidAPI to create a chart.

https://rapidapi.com/SAdrian/api/data-imdb1/ 

Use the route /getAwardsById to get awarded actors

A bar chat is now created based on how many awards are gotten in a particular year.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
